# NPR.Today

Site by [Agent L Productions](http://agentl.productions)

This site is basically just a playground for me to learn about Javascript, CSS, linux web hosting, and more.

It is based off of [this stream schedule](http://www.npr.org/audiohelp/progstream.html). The clock on the site is an hourly clock that updates depending on the current program. If the line seems off, check your computer's local time.

Feel free to take a look at the source and adapt as you please.
