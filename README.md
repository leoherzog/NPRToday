    <p>This site is basically just a playground for me to learn about Javascript, CSS, linux web hosting, and more.</p>
    <p>It is based off of <a href="http://www.npr.org/audiohelp/progstream.html" target="_blank">this stream schedule</a>. The clock on the site is an hourly clock that updates depending on the current program. If the line seems off, check your computer's local time.</p>
